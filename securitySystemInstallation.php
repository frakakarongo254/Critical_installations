                <p class="description">
                  Ip surveillance systems use internal protocol  cameras (Ip Camera) a type of digital video camera
                that sends and receives data via a computer
                networks and the internet.
                Diversing a comprehensive security solution for
                medium to large scale commercial, educational
                and residential complexes can pose numerous
                logistical challenges you would need a large
                number of securing guards to cover the area adequately
                and even that doesn’t guarantee safety,
                while CCTV system can ensure ample coverage,
                the solution has its draw backs CCTV systems
                require extensive wiring, which can both interfere
                with the area’s aesthetics and prove prohibited
                expensive in larger premises.
                <br>
                In case where you don’t want to compromise on
                the security of a large scale complex, you ensure
                that the aesthetics are maintained. Ip based
                wired video technology is the answer. The technology
                of the future , Ip video technology uses
                a common network cable to power the system,
                connect the network and to send data. It enable
                round the clock monitory of every inch of the
                promises. Additionally users can monitor and
                record video remotely.
                The wired Ip surveillance system provides an
                ascetically pleasing, comprehensive and cost
                effective surveillance solution, suitable for a wide
                range of industries and applications. As it utilizes
                just one wire. Installations of the Ip surveillance
                system can be integrated in to the plannmg stages
                of a building under construction. It can also be
                under taken during buildings renovations. That
                way, not only is the wiring concealed safe guarding
                the aesthetics of the area, there is no need to
                break through the walls again while installing the
                system.

                  CIS&S ltd is a leading institute of solar powered
                  street lights, having installed several
                  solar lights for non-governmental organizations
                  like; Kitemoto Gated Community Estate.
                  Instead of using the traditional halogen lamps
                  which consumes about 400 to 1500 watts of
                  power, our solar powered LED lamps consumes
                  from 20 to 150 watts with a similar or
                  better luminous intensity giving rise to bright
                  solar powered street, walk paths, bays, roads
                  and other places that require all night lighting.
                  Solar Street lighting can enable county government
                  significantly reduce their electricity
                  bills as well as reduce cost of wiring of new
                  street lights over long distance. Institutions
                  with bays and ware houses that needs all
                  night flood lights can significantly reduce their
                  electricity costs by installing solar powered
                  flood lights and street lights hence increasing
                  the profits.
                  At CIS&S, we do a complete energy audit and
                  recommend the best solutions to implement
                  including using energy efficiencies appliances

                            All electricald systems require periodic mwtenance in addition to non scheduled maintenance
            caused by u npredictable events such as storms, accidents and equipment failure. The intent of

            clients. Certain maintenance activities are common to all systems, regardless of the type. This
            activities should always be performed on the circle applicable for the system.
