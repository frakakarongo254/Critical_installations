The waterproof infrared rear camera connects to the front unit via a 15m (49ft) video cable, with option for 20m (65ft). This allows to monitor not only the road behind, but also cargo loading and unloading operations. </p>
           <h4><b>DASHCAM FOR HEAVY VEHICLES BLACKVUE DR750S-2CH TRUCK</b></h4>
           <p>DR750S-2CH TRUCK features Full HD Sony STARVIS™ front camera and waterproof rear camera with embedded IR light to fit externally on the back of trucks and most commercial vehicles. Perfect dashcam for fleet management.</p>
          <h4 class="title"><b>INFRARED EXTERNAL REAR CAMERA</b> WITH RUGGED METAL WATERPROOF CASING</h4>
          <p>With its metal waterproof casing the rear camera of the DR750S-2CH TRUCK is built to withstand most weather conditions.

          It is designed to be installed at the rear of truck or heavy vehicles.

          We recommend to secure it in place on a flat surface using the provided screws.

          The luminosity sensor detects ambient brightness, activating automatically the six IR lights to help identify vehicles and objects even in the dark.</p>

            <h4 class="title"><b>Intelligent Parking Mode: better than a CCTV for your car</b></h4>
             <p>While driving, your BlackVue detects impacts and sudden changes in speed. While parked, it also detects movements*. Videos files are marked accordingly so that you can easily find the relevant ones in the BlackVue Viewer for Windows and Mac OS or the BlackVue App for Android and iOS.</p>

             <h4 class="title"><b>Secure Memory Management</b></h4>
             <p>BlackVue DR750S-2CH can prevent Event files (triggered manually or by impacts) overwriting. Up to fifty (50) files can be protected this way. Adaptive Format-Free File Management improves recording stability and reduces the need for microSD card formatting, while giving you the flexibility to change recording time unit (1/2/3 minutes) and quality settings.  Scheduled Reboot function of DR750S series can minimize unexpected errors happening in Parking Mode</p>

            <h4 class="title"><b>4K UHD + FULL HD CLOUD DASHCAM</b></h4>
             <p> With its 8-megapixel CMOS sensor in the main camera, the DR900S-2CH captures 4K Ultra High Definition video—four times as many pixels as Full HD. The rear Full HD Sony STARVIS™ image sensor ensures best image quality under any light. Thanks to the H.265 (HEVC) compression, your videos look better and file size is kept as small as ever.
              <br>
              <br>
            The front camera’s ultra-wide 162-degree angle takes full advantage of the 4K UHD resolution. The rear camera records in Full HD at a 139-degree angle with outstanding low-light sensitivity (great for cars with tint).
            Your BlackVue captures critical details while driving or in Parking Mode. With the free Over the Cloud add-on service, check on your car from anywhere, anytime.</p>

            ULTRA-CRISP VIDEOS, NOT JUST ON 4K MONITORS</h4>
            <p>4K UHD is four times as many pixels as Full HD*. This is a huge difference, and it shows.
            License plates can be made out more clearly and from further away.
            Besides, you don’t need a 4K monitor to appreciate 4K videos.
            Even on a Full HD monitor, you can zoom in much further without any visible pixelation.
            </p>
              <h4 class="title"><b>INTELLIGENT PARKING MODE MONITORING</b></h4>
              <p>BlackVue automatically switches to Parking Mode to monitor you parked vehicle.<br><br>
                <b>Parking Mode Event Voice Notifications:</b> upon exiting Parking Mode, your BlackVue tells you if Events were recorded when you were away from your car, so you can check right away the Event videos on the BlackVue App.
                <h4 class="title"><b>Scheduled Reboot:</b></h4>
                <p>Schedule a daily automatic reboot (optional—by default at night) to minimize potential errors. Reboots happen only if the dashcam is in Parking Mode and not writing data to the microSD card. This means no Normal driving, Event, or Parking Mode recording can be interrupted by a scheduled reboot.</p>
                <h4 class="title"><b>Super stealthy:</b></h4>
                <p>BlackVue DR900S Series allows you to completely turn off all LED indicators in Parking Mode. Only the recording LED indicator facing the interior of the vehicle will blink when motion or impact is detected.</p>

            <h4 class="title"><b>Front and Interior Full HD video and Wi-Fi connectivity</b></h4>
            <p>The DR590W-2CH IR records Full HD 1080p videos of the front and interior of your car at 30 frames per second, in a 139-degree wide view angle (interior 140 degrees).
            With the front camera’s Sony STARVIS™ imaging sensor, you get awesome image clarity day and night.
            The interior infrared camera records clear videos even in complete darkness thanks to its discreet infrared illumination LEDs.</p>

       <h4 class="title"><b>BUILT-IN WI-FI</b></h4>
           
         <p>Connect with the BlackVue App for iOS/Android to adjust settings and download videos to your phone.</p>
         <h4 class="title"><b>Interior Infrared Camera</b></h4>
          <p>The Interior IR Full HD camera is equipped with an illumination sensor and infrared LED which light is barely visible to the eye.
          These allow the capture of clear images in pitch black lighting conditions.</p>
           <h4 class="title"><b>Set up (easily) and forget</b></h4>
          <p>BlackVue dash​cams are very easy to install. Attach the front unit to the windshield behind the rear view mirror with the provided double-sided tape. This way, the dash​cam is invisible to the driver’s eye. The interior camera faces the driver, ideally above the rear view mirror and connects to the front unit with the included video cable.
          Simply plug the power cords into the cigarette lighter / accessory power socket of your vehicle and it will automatically start recording as you turn ignition on.
          Once set, you can forget about it, knowing it will reliably record your drive.</p>
