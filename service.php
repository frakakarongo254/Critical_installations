              <p class="description">Few employers want to allow all their employees access to all facilities
              all of the time. That’s why more and more businesses are using electronic
              access control solutions to limit employees’ admission to certain
              areas.
              At a bare minimum, an electronic access control system can be used
              to allow only authorised employees into a building after hours, and to
              provide excellent documentation of when and where employees enter and exit.
              This system is also the only technology that proactively attempts to keep unauthorised individuals
              out of a building, or certain areas within a facility. It’s also a perfect complement to video surveillance
              and burglar and fire systems , making it part of a comprehensive security solution.
              An access control system also eliminates problems associated with mechanical key and lock systems,
              such as the time and cost of replacing keys when an employee’s contract is terminated, the
              cost of duplicate keys, lost keys, tracking who has the keys, and worrying about easy-to-duplicate
              keys landing up in the wrong hands.
